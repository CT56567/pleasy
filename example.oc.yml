# This file specifies various settings for opencourse to work.
# Many settings are set by the context itself
# project: is the root folder by default opencourse-project. It will be used as the right most part of the URL. I suggest you build into oc instead.
# site: the default install is dev, but the project comes from opencourse.
# docroot: is the uppermost webroot folder, default is: docroot. Since this system can be used for other drupal distros, it could be web or html
# user: The username of the user. default=carlos in honour of Carlos Acutis. Therefore the path is /home/user/sitename/folder/sfolder
# address: site.project
# database: for each site it will be siteproject (ie same as address, but without the .) database username and password are all the same. Unless specified otherwise
# Database root user. This is used to create new databases.
# Drush aliases will also be automatically created when a site is installed. The alias is: @siteproject
