# Pleasy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rjzaar/pleasy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rjzaar/pleasy)

This is a Devops framework for drupal sites, particularly based on varbase.
The framework is run through the pl (short for please), plcd and plvi commands.
The pl command has been added to bash commands so can be accessed anywhere. It is followed by the script name and 
usually which instance to be worked on, eg "pl backup varc" will backup the 'varc' instance (varc is a varbase install using composer)
There is a yaml file which contains the framework setup (pl.yml). An example yaml file is provided and is ready to be used, with 
some tweaking required ('example.pl.yml' copy this file to pl.yml and tweak it).
You set pleasy up with the following commands

```
sudo apt update
cd $home
git clone https://github.com/mayostudio/pleasy.git
sudo bash ./pleasy/bin/pl  init
sudo source ~/.bashrc
pl update
```
Now edit pl.yml with your settings or just use the defaults

You will now have a functioning pleasy.

You should now be able to install your first site:
```
pl install d9
```
OR if you want to install the varbase distribution
```
pl install varc
```
You can then move around between sites using plcd
```angular2html
plcd d9 #Takes you to the root of the site
plcd d9 d #Takes you to the webroot of the site
plcd d9 t #Takes you to the default theme of the site
plcd d9 b #Takes you to the backups of the site
plcd d9 sd #Takes you to the sites/default folder of the site
plcd a #Takes you to /etc/apache2/sites-available
plcd b #Takes you to site backups
plcd l #Takes you to /usr/local/bin
plcd s #Takes you to pleasy scripts
plcd x #Takes you to /etc/nginx/sites-available
```

The infrastructure for each site is setup including a stage version, eg for d9 the stage version is stg_d9.
Once a production version is created (follow the instructions in the server script readme to set up the production site [readme](https://github.com/rjzaar/pleasy/blob/master/server/README.md)), both production and test sites are also created by the initserver script, ie prod_d9 and test_d9.

Here is the overview of all the possible locations using the d9 sitename as an example.

**d9**          the main dev site for d9 stored locally. Location: [www_path][sitename] Backup: [pleasy][sitebackups][sitename]

eg: Location "/var/www/oc/d9" backup "/home/[USER]/pleasy/sitebackups/d9" URL: pleasy.d9

**stg_d9**      the stage site for d9 stored locally.   Location: [www_path][sitename] Backup: [pleasy][sitebackups][sitename]

eg: Location "/var/www/oc/stg_d9" backup "/home/[USER]/pleasy/sitebackups/stg_d9" URL: pleasy.stg_d9

**prod_d9**     the production site for d9 on the server.

eg: Location "/var/www/[siteurl]" backup "/home/[USER]/[siteurl]/" URL: [siteurl]

**test_d9**     the test site for d9 on the server.

eg: Location "/var/www/test.[siteurl]" backup "/home/[USER]/test.[siteurl]/" URL: test.[siteurl]

**d9_prod**     This is just to store the production backup locally.

eg: There is no location. backup "/home/[USER]/pleasy/sitebackups/d9/prod/" There is no URL.

Drush also works. Each sitename becomes the alias. This can be accessed from anywhere.
```angular2html
drush @d9 status #runs the status command on the d9 site.
drush @stg_d9 status #runs the status command on the stage version of d9 site.
drush @prod_d9 status #runs the status commend on the production version of the d9 site, if there is a production version of the site.
drush @test_d9 status #runs the status commend on the test version of the loc site which is on the production server, if it is setup.
```
Drupal console aliases are also setup.

# Config: pl.yml

The main configuration is in a single file called pl.yml. This is created from the example.pl.yml file. pl.yml needs
to be edited to suit the current user, eg setting github credentials. But it has enough information to be useable 
out of the box. The following site information is ready to go

d9: Drupal 9 install

d9c: Drupal 9 composer install

varg: varbase-project install using git

vard: dev varbase-project install using composer

varc: varbase-project install using composer 

More specifically the following variables are set in pl.yml

hosts_path: "/etc/hosts"

vhosts_path: "/etc/apache2/sites-available/"

www_path: "/var/www/oc"

host_database: mysql

# VARBASE

It provides various scripts for development processes which incorporate composer, cmi and backup. Communication with the 
production server is via drush and git or scp.
This project is also based on the varbase two repository structure, varbase and varbase-project.
This is a good way to go since most updates to varbase don't need to be updated on a varbase based project.
Those that do are included in varbase-project.
There are also a lot less files to track in varbase-project than varbase itself.

A particular site based project needs to include site specific files which should be stored on a private 
repository for backup. 

# WORKFLOW

There are several ways to run the workflow. The simplest is via tar files.
Once you have a production server, eg vanilla ubuntu 20.04 server. You should follow the server readme
to setup the server. Once the server is setup you need to add your production server details to pl.yml. 
You will then be able to push up your site to the server, eg 'pl prodow stg_d9'. 'Prodow' stands for PRODuction OverWrite,

To pull down the site use 'pl proddown stg_d9' and this will download and install the site to stg_d9.


Opencourse (ocrepo): A repo for just the code for opencourse (dev environment)

Production site repo (prodrepo): A repo of all of the site files (prod environment) Master branch stores prod. Dev
branch stores the new prod to be pushed up.

Production database repo (prod.sql): A private secure repo for the live database (ocback).

The suggest best way to run workflow is explained in this presentation: 
https://events.drupal.org/vienna2017/sessions/advanced-configuration-management-config-split-et-al
  at 29:36
  
This has been implemented with the following commands
Merge dev into master (or other branch)
```
pl gcom #will export config and commit to git
git pull # Check the pull works.
git merge master
pl runup #will run any updates. Check all is good.
git checkout master 
git merge dev #check for errors.
git push
git checkout dev # back to work
```
Process to push to production
```
pl proddown stg #copy prod to stg
pl gcom loc
pl dev2stg loc #will use git to move dev files to stg. stg has prodrepo.
pl runup stg #run updates on stage and check site.
```
You can repeat these steps to set up the live test site on the production server

```
pl updateprod stg_loc -td
```
And/or you can run them on the live production server.
```
pl updateprod # This repeats the steps on Prod. Check all is well.
```
If there is a problem on production.

```
pl restoreprod  #This restores Prod to the old site. Only if needed.
```
 
# BACKUP AND RESTORE

The backup command is able to backup any site to its sitebackup folder, eg /var/www/oc/d9 is backed up to 
/home/[USER]/[siteurl]/[backupname].sql and [backupname].tar.gz

The [backupname] is generated from the date, time, git hash code and backup message.

If the production site is backed up, it will be backed up on the server, ie pl backup prod_d9.
If the production site is backed up to prod, ie pl backup prod_d9 prod, then it will also be
stored locally in /home/[USER]/[siteurl]/prod/[backupname].sql location (including the tar 
file).

The restore command will restore the site from a chosen backup or to a new location. 


# PLEASY RATIONALE

What makes pleasy different? Pleasy is trying to use the simplest tools (bash scripting) to leverage drupal and varbase tools 
to provide the simplest and yet powerful devops environment. This way it is easy for beginners to adopt and even improve, yet
powerful enough to use for production. It tries to take the suggested best practice from Drupal documentation and turn it into
scripts. It hopes to grow into a complete devops solution incorporating the best tools and practices available. 

# ROADMAP

1) The varbase use of Phing to install the site needs to be integrated into pleasy.

2) The varbase script varbase-update.sh needs to be integrated into pleasy.

4) All the remaining scripts (ie with status todo) need to be updated and integrated.

5) All scripts tested with CircleCI

6) This will become a 1.0 release

7) Lando or docker integrated into pleasy using https://github.com/pendashteh/landrop. This will be a 2.0 release

8) New functions to set up site testing using varbase behat code.

9) Automatic CircleCI testing of any commits.

10) These new functions to set up CircleCI tests that respond to drupal core security updates automatically and if passing auto push to production.

11) New update functions to set up CircleCI tests that respond to varbase project updates, test automatically and create stage site which is tested automatically. One line code push to production.

Other improvements: Varnish as an option. Incorporate https://github.com/drevops/drevops
